This tool installs a binary called `tockloader`, which supports several commands:

### `tockloader listen`

Listen to UART `printf()` data from a board.

### `tockloader list`

Print information about the apps currently loaded onto the board.

### `tockloader install`

Load Tock applications on to the board. Use `--no-replace` to install
multiple copies of the same app.

binary.

### `tockloader uninstall [application name(s)]`

Remove an application from flash by its name.

### `tockloader flash`

Load binaries onto hardware platforms that are running a compatible bootloader.
This is used by the [TockOS](https://github.com/helena-project/tock) Make system
when application binaries are programmed to the board with `make program`.

### `tockloader list-attributes`

Show all of the attributes that are stored on the board.

### `tockloader set-attribute [attribute key] [attribute value]`

an existing attribute if the key matches.
